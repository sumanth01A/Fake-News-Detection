# Fake-News-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. We used the Fake and Real News Dataset and built classification models like Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify news articles as real or fake.
